This project consists of 2 Files, excluding the output, input and README file. These Files are
    - Main.java

The Main class contains the main method responsible for reading the input file, executing operations on the Lazy Binary
Search Tree, and writing the results to an output file. The LazyBinarySearchTree class implements a binary search tree with lazy deletion,
including methods for insert, delete, findMin, findMax, contains, toString, height, and size.
