This repository contains a collection of small-scale projects and tutorials I've completed while learning new programming languages, tools, and frameworks.
Each project is focused on practicing specific concepts and building a deeper understanding by building. BUILD BUILD BUILD!!!!. 
The goal is not to build full applications, but to solidify fundamentals and explore new technologies in a practical way.
